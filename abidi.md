Name: Akif Abidi
Major: Computer Science
What I want to learn: I have had a big passion for machine learning and AI in general for a while.
Though I have done some projects in high school, I am very excited to work on something thats more
than just some tutorial you can find on youtube, but rather is something thats being used in the real world. Bottom line, I am excited to gain some real world experience in one of the fastest growing, and 
fascinating, fields today.
